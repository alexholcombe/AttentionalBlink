Patrick Goodbourn programmed mixture modeling RSVP serial position errors in MATLAB. [Certifiedwaif](https://github.com/certifiedwaif/) [ported](https://github.com/certifiedwaif/AttentionalBlink) it to R.

## Issues

Still having trouble capturing error msgs like "Error in eigen(nhatend) : infinite or missing values in 'x'"

Someday switch to Bayesian  Stan via brms. See "mixture" function in [brms manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/brms.pdf) and [this post](http://andrewgelman.com/2017/08/21/mixture-models-stan-can-use-log_mix/) by Gelman on mixture models in stan

## Questions for Pat

Why did he pad with zeros the pseudo_uniform distribution?
